# Cleanup 
Cleanup is a novel DSP algorithm for denoising speech. Cleanup is donationware except for paid reuse.

It is designed to work primarily on radio- shortwave, FM, VHF, UHF. It does beat any AI.

It is designed to work at a 48hkz input rate, but will work at other sampling rates with moderate predictability.

The use of a notch filter(carrier suppression) is highly advised before this algorithm in the pipeline.

Other noise filtration methods should be placed after cleanup.

All the interface options have tooltip instructions.
