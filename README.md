# Cleanup 
Cleanup is a novel DSP algorithm for denoising speech. Cleanup is free donationware for individuals,\
and is licensed for commercial users in a permissive manner depending on use, see license details.\
It is designed to work primarily on radio- shortwave, FM, VHF, UHF. It does beat any AI currently on the market.\
It is designed to work at a 48hkz input rate, but the core algorithm can be adapted for use at 6,12,and 24k rates.\
The use of a notch filter(carrier suppression) is highly advised before this algorithm in the pipeline.\
Other noise filtration methods should be placed after cleanup.

All the interface options in the vst3 and lv2 have tooltip instructions.\
To ensure audacity compatibility, vst3 does not have support for direct parameter settings.
