What inspired the free as in free toothpaste license?
let's say you're really interested in making sure people can brush their teeth
so you introduce a low-cost toothpaste made using simple ingredients, but you figure out
a special way to mix them so that they're as effective as leading brands.

Kind of like how Tech Ingredients https://www.youtube.com/@TechIngredients wanted to introduce a better thermal paste compound.

But let's also say that you don't want people to take your toothpaste, add advertising and new labels, and sell it as their own.
And you might also think it inappropriate for them to sell toothbrushing services and use your toothpaste and upsell the service
as if they used toothpaste which cost as much as the brands they can buy in the store.

That's why this software is licensed `free as in free toothpaste`. It's freeware but for toothpaste.
Adoption and use are legally unhindered- anyone can `use` the software without being in violation of licensing.
However, the legal re-use for a profitable purpose is considered on a `what value do you add` basis and requires some compensation.

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. COPYRIGHT HOLDER ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY FOR
ANY INJURIES OR EXPENSES SUSTAINED IN THE ACT OF FULFILLING ANY OF 
THE ABOVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, ACCIDENTAL OR OTHERWISE.

For the purposes of this license agreeement, "the software/this software" refers to the copyright protected
and licensed binaries and source code offered in this repository. 
"programs" consist of software developed by you or others.
"devices" consist of any physical electronic device you develop, license or sell.
In the eventuality that you develop programs which incorporate the software, and distribute them on devices,
and do not charge for the programs, but do charge for devices, you agree your usage shall be considered
under the provisions for incorporation into devices, and not incorporation into programs, likewise, if
the opposite is true(you charge for programs but not for the devices), you agree your usage shall be considered
under the provisions for incorporation into programs, and not incorporation into devices.

 You may use the software, including wrapping it in an x86 emulator on non-x86 systems, 
including shipping it with your software and/or hardware, providing the following conditions are met:
You may not reverse engineer the software. You may not modify the software.
Any audio you produce with the software belongs to the copyright holder of the person who owned the audio that was processed.
Other terms must be met additionally as provided below. 
Terms in the "applying to personal use" section apply to the direct use of the software by an end user, for personal and education uses only.
Terms in the "commercial and government direct use" section apply to the installation and operation of the software on work-related electronic devices
in a public or private workplace. terms in the "reuse" section apply to the integration and packaging of the software with other programs and devices for resale,
leasing, or other forms of distribution which may or may not entail compensation to the manufacturer. 

If you do not agree to the terms you may not use the software.

==TERMS APPLYING TO TO PERSONAL USE==
This software is free for personal use. You may install it on as many computers as you like, and use it however you like within the terms of the license agreement.
Additionally, if you use the software in an educational capacity, whether as part of a public or private sector academic institution, then your use shall be considered personal.
==END TERMS APPLYING TO TO PERSONAL USE==

==TERMS APPLYING TO COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT DIRECT USE=
You may not intentionally use the software to provide communications services to warfighting personnel actively engaged in combat
in a foreign theatre of war if that use is to coordinate or facilitate attack operations on any adversary, 
unless that activity is covered under an active declaration of war by your nation's legislative body.

You may not use the software as part of warrantless covert government surveillance efforts on citizens of your own nation. 
You are honor-bound to pay the copyright holder $2 per month per relay or instance where the program is installed. 
A non-expiring license costs $240 and voids the requirement to pay a monthly recompensation for a single relay or instance.

The commercial and government terms do not apply to individuals or organizations in the private sector covered under re-use.
Likewise, only the direct usage of the software is considered `honor-bound`- the incorporation of the software into a paid program, service, or device shall be considered
re-use. 
==END TERMS APPLYING TO COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT USE=


==TERMS APPLYING TO REUSE==
You may not(unless you give all of the royalties to copyright holder) take compensation for the software directly,
whether to install it, make it available, activate, unlock, enable, include, or any other such mechanism.
You agree that the distribution of any program which incorporates the software must have a substantial purpose other than noise reduction,
and if it does not, it must be considered "enabling" and all royalties are to be forfeited to the copyright holder.
For the purpose of this license, "substantial" explicitly excludes equalizers, other denoising algorithms, resampling algorithms,decoding/encoding algorithms,
audio device handling logic, audio device drivers, display interface logic, or algorithms and programming necessary to use the aforementioned together-
You agree the presence of any or all of these items do not create a "substantial purpose" and do not provide an exception to the forfeiture of royalties.


This license agreement provides for the intentional and intelligent recompensation of copyright holder from profits earned on the basis
of the usage of the software in "re-use" scenarios with the understanding that "re-use" consists of incorporating the software into value-added devices and programs which
do not have as a sole purpose "noise reduction"(which is covered above by the "you may not take compensation directly"), or are noise reduction devices.

You may sell and you may distribute programs and devices incorporating the software provided that you comply with the following:
You agree to recompensate the copyright holder $100 per device that incorporates the software.
You agree to pay the copyright holder $2 per month per relay or instance, providing you are a service provider who charges for a service,
and your service incorporates the use of the software in any capacity, or to purchase a commercial non-expiring license for each relay and instance.
You agree to share earnings from software with copyright owner of $5 per paid copy you sell of said software.
    
In all cases where in all respects your programs, services and hardware are freely provided to users, and you receive no contractual or obligated compensation,
you owe nothing to the copyright holder- the software is free for you to use and incorporate into your services, programs and devices.

Regardless of reuse, you must include with your device or software or service documentation this license and copyright declaration, making them available to end users.
If your use is free, you must provide with said license a notice that the software is free donationware and the copyright holder earnestly seeks their support,
donations which can be provided through the link in the software interface or via other means as the user deigns appropriate.

if your service, device or product is free to your users, and if you do not provide a means for the user to access the interface and access the website URL linked in the software donation URL,
You must provide either a copy or instructions to obtain a copy, and instructions on how to access the software for seperate use without your devices or programs.
This notice must be reasonably prominent- printed on a card and included with devices intended for end users, included in a statement on the service primary access portal
in easy view in some small dedicated block, or, if you incorporate the software into a program, included as a prominent part of the documentation.
However, if your program or device or service provides the means to directly access the software's interface and open the URL in a browser, you do not need to display any notice in any interface.
