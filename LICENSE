For the purposes of this license agreeement, "the software/this software" refers to the copywrite protected
and licensed binaries and source code offered in this repository.

This software is free. You may use it, including wrapping it in an x86 emulator on non-x86 systems, 
including shipping it with your software or hardware, providing the following conditions are met:
You may not reverse engineer the software. You may not modify the software.
You may not intentionally use the software to provide communications services to active military personnel engaged in wartime combat activity
unless that activity is covered by an active declaration of war by your nation's legislative body.
You may not use the software as part of warrantless surveillance efforts on citizens of your own nation. 
You may not(unless you give all of the royalties to copywrite holder) charge explicitly for the software, 
either to install it, make it available, activate, unlock, enable, include, or any other such mechanism.

You may sell and you may distribute devices incorporating the software provided that you comply with the following:  
  If your device is not free(you make money on it more than 6% profit) you must share some of your profits with copywrite holder, as follows:
      if any reasonable court would consider the software the primary or sole contributor to the function of the devices, send half of your profits after all expenses to the copywrite holder.
      Otherwise, send 10%.
  Regardless, you must provide at least one of the devices(the highest-priced device you make that incorporates the software) to the copywrite holder.
  
You may sell and distribute your own programs incoporating or making use through a host mechanism, the software, provided you comply with the requirements 
on hardware devices. This means you must consider the contributory value of the software, your own licensing situation, and must provide a copy.


Regardless of your use, you must include with your device or software this license and copywrite declaration.

The software provided here is declared to nominally work on a carrier-free(notch-filtered) 16 or 24 bit 48khz audio signal, to provide adequet noise filtration and impulse noise immunity for voice activity only,
to cause only a 170.66ms delay, and to work within 32MB of memory on any SSE2 or newer x86-64 system running windows 10 or newer.
Binaries for your platform and architecture are available on request.
