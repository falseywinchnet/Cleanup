Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants to Licensee
a limited and nonexclusive license (without the right to sublicense)
to execute one (1) copy of the Software, in executable object code form only,
solely on the device that Licensee own or controls and solely for use for Licensee's personal, non-commercial purposes,
except for specific provisions as declared elsewhere in this agreement.


Licensee may use the software, including wrapping it in an x86 emulator 
on non-x86 systems,  including shipping it with Licensee's software 
and/or hardware, provided the following conditions are met:

Licensee may not reverse engineer the software. Licensee may not modify 
the software. Any audio Licensee modifies or produces with the software 
is intellectual property of the intellectual property holder of the 
rights to the audio processed with the software(what Licensee gets out 
is owned by who owns what Licensee put in).
Other terms must be met additionally as provided below. 

For this license agreement, "programs" shall consist of software 
developed by Licensee or others, and "devices" shall consist of any 
physical electronic device Licensee develops, licenses or sells.
For the purposes of this license, 'incorporation' of the Software 
into other programs or devices is defined as the integration of the 
Software's functionality into such programs or devices that makes use 
of the Software's primary features or functions. 'Distribution' refers 
to the act of making the Software available to others through selling, 
leasing, or otherwise transferring copies of the Software in its 
standalone form or as part of other software or devices.

In the eventuality that Licensee develops programs which incorporate 
the software, and distributes them on devices, and does not charge for 
the programs, but does charge for devices, Licensee agrees the usage 
shall be considered under the provisions for incorporation into devices, 
and not incorporation into programs, likewise, if the opposite is 
true(Licensee charges for programs but not for the devices), Licensee 
agrees the usage shall be considered under the provisions for 
incorporation into programs, and not incorporation into devices.

In the eventuality that Licensee utilizes the outputs of the Software 
to train a machine learning method to replicate the behavior of the Software,
Licensee agrees that these actions shall constitute "reverse engineering"
and constitute a breach of license. 

In the eventuality that Licensee utilizes the outputs of the Software to 
train a machine learning method to replicate the behavior of the Software, 
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that such conduct will be deemed "reverse engineering".

Furthermore, Licensee additionally agrees that to modify, translate, decompile, disassemble 
or generate works derived from the Software,shall be considered "reverse-engineering".

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the Software contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information
of the copyright holder, that any reverse engineering actual or threatened will constitute 
immediate, irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy,
and that injunctive relief is an appropriate but not limiting remedy for such breach.
Therefore, under such circumstances, the copyright holder reserves the right to pursue all remedies 
available under law, including but not limited to, seeking injunctive relief, damages, 
and any applicable statutory penalties. 



Terms in the "applying to personal use" section shall apply to the direct 
use of the software by an end user, for personal and education uses only.

software with other programs and devices for resale, leasing, or 
other forms of distribution which may or may not entail compensation 
to the manufacturer(s) or creator(s). 


Changes to this Agreement will apply only to new uses or distribution 
of the Software. All previous uses and distributions will be governed 
by the Agreement in place at the time of that use or distribution. 
Any changes to the Agreement will be communicated clearly and directly 
to all current users and distributors. Neither the rights nor the obligations 
arising under this EULA are assignable by the Licensor, and any such attempted assignment
shall be void and without effect.

If any provision of this EULA is unenforceable, such provision will be changed and interpreted
to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable
law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

All waivers by the copyright holder will be effective only if in writing.
Any waiver or failure by the copyright holder to enforce any provision of this license agreement
on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.


The agreement is concluded for an indefinite period.

and Licensee must destroy all copies in their possession. In the event 
that Licensee violates the terms of this agreement, Licensee's rights to 
use the software are suspended, Licensee is required to cease use of the 
software and destroy all copies in their possession until such a time as 
the violation is remedied to the satisfaction of the copyright holder.

==TERMS APPLYING TO TO PERSONAL USE==
This software is free for personal use. Licensee may install it on as 
many computers as they like, and use it however Licensee likes within 
the terms of the license agreement.

Licensee is prohibited from passing on the Software or copies thereof to a third party in return for payment.
Licensee is prohibited to pass on, rent or lease the Software to a third party for business purposes, 
or to use it in any other form for commercial purposes. 

Additionally, if Licensee uses the software in an educational capacity, 
whether as part of a public or private sector academic institution, then 
Licensee's use shall be considered personal, unless Licensee was paid to
administer training or educate others and used the software as part of a 
compensated activity. Such use shall be considered commercial.
==END TERMS APPLYING TO TO PERSONAL USE==

==TERMS APPLYING TO COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT DIRECT USE=
The Software may not be used to support or facilitate communications 
pertaining to battle planning or tactical command channels involved 
with offensive military operations in foreign territories or over 
international waters without a formal declaration of war by Licensee's 
nation's legislative body. Communications which pertain to the operations
of airborne assets in response to hostile anticipated airspace intrusion
is considered non-offensive and is permitted.

Licensee may not use the software as part of warrantless covert 
government surveillance efforts on citizens of Licensee's nation. 
Licensee is expected, but not legally required(Licensees are honor-bound)
to pay the copyright holder $2 per month per instance where the program 
is installed. A non-expiring license costs $240 and voids the requirement 
to pay a monthly recompensation for a single instance.

Licensee is not permitted to directly charge Licensee's customers, clients, 
or others for the specific use of this software as part of a service. Any 
service Licensee provides that leverages this software as part of 
value-added work done for customers, clients or others, even as part of 
a broader offering where the usage is unclear or undeclared, shall be 
considered "re-use" and must be licensed under the "re-use" provision. 

Licensee is prohibited from passing on the Software or copies thereof to a third party in return for payment.
Licensee is prohibited to pass on, rent or lease the Software to a third party for business purposes, 
or to use it in any other form for commercial purposes. 

The commercial and government terms do not apply to individuals or 
organizations in the private sector covered under re-use, including 
military contractors providing communication services and derived, licensed
reuse consisting of incorporations into value-added devices and software 
installed on devices. Likewise, only the direct usage of the software 
is considered `honor-bound`- the incorporation of the software 
into a paid program, service, or device shall be considered re-use. 
==END TERMS APPLYING TO COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT USE=


==TERMS APPLYING TO REUSE==

Licensee is prohibited from passing on the Software or copies thereof to a third party in return for payment.
Licensee is prohibited to pass on, rent or lease the Software to a third party for business purposes, 
or to use it in any other form for commercial purposes, except as provided under the specific conditions listed below:

Licensee may not(unless Licensee gives all of the royalties to copyright 
holder) take compensation for the software, whether to install it, make 
it available, activate, unlock, enable, include, or any other such 
mechanism, unless it is covered by one of the four categories 
below listed:

Category 1: DSP software distribution:

Licensee agrees that the distribution of any program which incorporates 
the software must have a substantial purpose other than noise reduction,
and if it does not, it must be considered "enabling" and all royalties 
are to be forfeited to the copyright holder. For the purpose of this 
license, "substantial" explicitly excludes equalizers, other denoising 
algorithms, resampling algorithms,decoding/encoding algorithms, audio 
device handling logic, audio device drivers, audio mixers, audio 
compressors or expanders, audio gain control algorithms,  display 
interface logic, or algorithms and programming necessary to use the 
aforementioned together- Licensee agrees the presence of any or all 
of these items do not create a "substantial purpose" and do not provide 
an exception to the forfeiture of royalties.

Category 2: Devices which may have as a primary purpose denoising or 
digital signal processing, and programs and devices which have other 
substantial purposes:

Licensee may sell and may distribute programs and devices incorporating 
the software provided that licensee complies with the following:
Licensee agrees to recompensate the copyright holder $100 per device 
that incorporates the software. Licensee agrees to pay the copyright 
holder $2 per month per instance, providing licensee is a service provider 
that charges for a service, and licensee's service incorporates the use 
of the software in any capacity, or to purchase a commercial non-expiring 
license for each relay and instance. Licensee agrees to share earnings 
from programs sold with copyright owner of $5 per copy licensee sells 
of said programs.


Category 3: Free reuse for non-gratis reusers:

In the scenario where licensee's programs, services and hardware are 
freely provided to users, and licensee receives no contractual or obligated
compensation, licensee owes nothing to copyright holder- the software is 
free for licensee to use and incorporate into licensee's services, 
programs and devices.

if licensee's service, device or product is free to licensees users, and 
if licensee does not provide a means for the user to access the interface 
and access the website URL linked in the software donation URL, licensee 
must provide either a copy or instructions to obtain a copy, 
and instructions on how to access the software for seperate use without 
licensee's devices or programs. This notice must be reasonably prominent- 
printed on a card and included with devices intended for end users, 
included in a statement on the service primary access portal in easy view 
in some small dedicated block, or, if licensee incorporates the software 
into a program, included as a prominent part of the documentation.
However, if licensee's program or device or service provides the means to 
directly access the software's interface and open the URL in a browser, 
licensee does not need to display any notice in any interface.

Category 4: recursive reuse for pro-bono freeware reusers:

In all cases where licensee's programs, services, or hardware are 
nominally free, but include a provision establishing or indicating, but 
not mandating, that a license and additional support, but not other 
services besides support, can be obtained through compensation, such as a 
honor-bound commercial licensing scenario similar to what the software offers,
licensee is honor-bound to redistribute a prospective 5% of their 
compensation(or as much up to 5% as license can reasonably give without 
creating undue hardship for licensee) to copyright holder, and the usage 
shall be considered as free reuse(Licensee is obligated to fulfill the 
provision of category 3 pertaining to the notice).

Irrespective of reuse category, licensee must include with their device 
or software or service documentation this license and copyright 
declaration, making them available to end users.

==END REUSE TERMS==

 All supplements to this contract, including this clause, must be made in writing.

==END LICENSE==
