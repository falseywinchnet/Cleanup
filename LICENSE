For the purposes of this license agreeement, "the software/this software" refers to the copyright protected
and licensed binaries and source code offered in this repository.

This software is free. You may use it, including wrapping it in an x86 emulator on non-x86 systems, 
including shipping it with your software and/or hardware, providing the following conditions are met:
You may not reverse engineer the software. You may not modify the software.
You may not intentionally use the software to provide communications services to warfighting personnel actively engaged in combat
in a foreign theatre of war if that use is to coordinate or facilitate attack operations on any adversary, 
unless that activity is covered under an active declaration of war by your nation's legislative body.

You may not use the software as part of warrantless surveillance efforts on citizens of your own nation. 
You may not(unless you give all of the royalties to copyright holder) charge explicitly for the software, 
either to install it, make it available, activate, unlock, enable, include, or any other such mechanism.

You may sell and you may distribute devices incorporating the software provided that you comply with the following:  
  If your device is not free(you make money on it more than 6% profit) you must share some of your profits with copyright holder, as follows:
      if any reasonable court would consider the software the primary or sole contributor to the unique value of the devices(as opposed to a device which does not use or include the software),
      send half of your profits after all expenses to the copyright holder. Otherwise, send 10%.
      If the device is a denoising DSP device, and includes multiple denoising methods, the contributive share should be allocated based on computational complexity of the methods alone,
      disregarding other capabilities of the device, which are not the primary reason for purchasing it.
      Should the software's computational complexity be the greatest of all algorithms included, and at least 10% greater than the next most complex, then it is the primary or sole contributor.
      If the device is a relay or radio with denoising methods included, then the software is understood not to be a primary or sole contributor to the unique value.
    
  Regardless, you must provide at least one of the devices(the highest-priced device you make that incorporates the software) to the copyright holder.
  
You may sell and distribute your own programs incoporating or making use through a host mechanism, the software, provided you comply with the requirements 
on hardware devices. This means you must consider the contributory value of the software, your own licensing situation, and must provide a copy.
    Programs sold or distributed with a specific purpose must consider the contributory value of the software to the unique value of the program,
    and if the program is considered a "denoising application" and the primary contributor to computational complexity of said program's denoising algorithms, 
    as stated in the hardware section above, is the software, your usage shall be considered "enabling" and therefore subject to the relevant part of this license(you get nothing).


Regardless of your use, you must include with your device or software this license and copywrite declaration.
You must provide with said declaration a notice that the software is free donationware and the copywrite holder earnestly seeks their support,
which can be provided through the link in the software interface or via other means as the user deigns appropriate.
If you do not provide a means to access the interface and access the website URL linked in the software donation URL,
You must provide either a copy or instructions to obtain a copy, and instructions on how to access the software for seperate use without your devices or programs.

The software provided here is declared to nominally work on a carrier-free(notch-filtered) 16 or 24 bit 48khz audio signal, to provide adequet noise filtration and impulse noise immunity for voice activity only,
to cause only a 170.66ms delay, and to work within 32MB of memory on any SSE2 or newer x86-64 system running windows 10 or newer.
Binaries for your platform and architecture are available on request.
