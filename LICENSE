What inspired the free as in free toothpaste license?
let's say you're really interested in making sure people can brush their teeth
so you introduce a low-cost toothpaste made using simple ingredients, but you figure out
a special way to mix them so that they're as effective as leading brands.

Kind of like how Tech Ingredients https://www.youtube.com/@TechIngredients wanted to introduce a better thermal paste compound.

But let's also say that you don't want people to take your toothpaste, add advertising and new labels, and sell it as their own.
And you might also think it inappropriate for them to sell toothbrushing services and use your toothpaste and upsell the service
as if they used toothpaste which cost as much as the brands they can buy in the store.

That's why this software is licensed `free as in free toothpaste`. It's freeware but for toothpaste.
Adoption and use are legally unhindered- anyone can `use` the software for personal uses, and use in the workplace entails some small
requirements but no legal obligation to compensate.
However, the re-use of the software for a profitable purpose(you are re-selling the toothpaste or charging others for it)
is considered on a `what value do you add` basis and requires some compensation.

Licensee may use the software, including wrapping it in an x86 emulator on non-x86 systems, 
including shipping it with Licensee's software and/or hardware, providing the following conditions are met:

Licensee may not reverse engineer the software. Licensee may not modify the software.
Any audio Licensee modifies or produces with the software is intellectual property of the intellectual property holder 
of the rights to the audio processed with the software(what Licensee gets out is owned by who owns what Licensee put in). 
Other terms must be met additionally as provided below. 

For this license agreement, "programs" shall consist of software developed by Licensee or others, and
"devices" shall consist of any physical electronic device Licensee develops, licenses or sells.

integration of the Software's functionality into such programs or devices that makes use of the Software's primary features or functions.
'Distribution' refers to the act of making the Software available to others through selling, leasing, 
or otherwise transferring copies of the Software in its standalone form or as part of other software or devices.

In the eventuality that Licensee develops programs which incorporate the software, and distributes them on devices,
and does not charge for the programs, but does charge for devices, Licensee agrees the usage shall be considered
under the provisions for incorporation into devices, and not incorporation into programs, likewise, if
the opposite is true(Licensee charges for programs but not for the devices), Licensee agrees the usage shall be considered
under the provisions for incorporation into programs, and not incorporation into devices.


Terms in the "applying to personal use" section shall apply to the direct use of the software by an end user, for personal and education uses only.
Terms in the "commercial and government direct use" section shall apply to the installation and operation of the software on work-related electronic devices

offensive military operations in foreign territories or over international waters without a formal declaration of war by Licensee's nation's legislative body.

Licensee may not use the software as part of warrantless covert government surveillance efforts on citizens of Licensee's nation. 
Licensee is expected, but not legally required(Licensees are honor-bound) to pay the copyright holder $2 per month per instance where the program is installed. 
A non-expiring license costs $240 and voids the requirement to pay a monthly recompensation for a single instance.

Licensee is not permitted to directly charge Licensee's customers, clients, or others for the specific use of this software as part of a service.
Any service Licensee provides that leverages this software as part of value-added work done for customers, clients or others, even as part of a broader offering

re-use. 
==END TERMS APPLYING TO COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT USE=


==TERMS APPLYING TO REUSE==
Licensee may not(unless Licensee gives all of the royalties to copyright holder) take compensation for the software,
whether to install it, make it available, activate, unlock, enable, include, or any other such mechanism, unless it is covered by one of the four categories below listed:

Category 1: DSP software distribution:

Licensee agrees that the distribution of any program which incorporates the software must have a substantial purpose other than noise reduction,
and if it does not, it must be considered "enabling" and all royalties are to be forfeited to the copyright holder.
For the purpose of this license, "substantial" explicitly excludes equalizers, other denoising algorithms, resampling algorithms,decoding/encoding algorithms,
audio device handling logic, audio device drivers, audio mixers, audio compressors or expanders, audio gain control algorithms, 
display interface logic, or algorithms and programming necessary to use the aforementioned together-
Licensee agrees the presence of any or all of these items do not create a "substantial purpose" and do not provide an exception to the forfeiture of royalties.

Category 2: Devices which may have as a primary purpose denoising or digital signal processing, and programs and devices which have other substantial purposes:

Licensee may sell and may distribute programs and devices incorporating the software provided that licensee complies with the following:
Licensee agrees to recompensate the copyright holder $100 per device that incorporates the software.
Licensee agrees to pay the copyright holder $2 per month per instance, providing licensee is a service provider that charges for a service,
and licensee's service incorporates the use of the software in any capacity, or to purchase a commercial non-expiring license for each relay and instance.
licensee agrees to share earnings from software with copyright owner of $5 per paid copy licensee sells of said software.


Category 3: Free reuse for non-gratis reusers:

In the scenario where licensee's programs, services and hardware are freely provided to users, and licensee receives no contractual or obligated compensation,
licensee owes nothing to copyright holder- the software is free for licensee to use and incorporate into licensee's services, programs and devices.

if licensee's service, device or product is free to licensees users, and if licensee does not provide a means for the user to access the interface and access the website URL linked in the software donation URL,
licensee must provide either a copy or instructions to obtain a copy, and instructions on how to access the software for seperate use without licensee's devices or programs.
This notice must be reasonably prominent- printed on a card and included with devices intended for end users, included in a statement on the service primary access portal
in easy view in some small dedicated block, or, if licensee incorporates the software into a program, included as a prominent part of the documentation.
However, if licensee's program or device or service provides the means to directly access the software's interface and open the URL in a browser, licensee does not need to display any notice in any interface.

category four: recursive reuse for pro-bono freeware reusers:

In all cases where licensee's programs, services, or hardware are nominally free, but include a provision mandating or indicating, but not mandating, that a license can be obtained
through compensation, licensee is honor-bound to redistribute a prospective 5% of their compensation(or as much up to 5% as license can reasonably give without creating undue hardship for licensee)
to copyright holder, and the usage shall be considered as free reuse.

Irrespective of reuse category, licensee must include with their device or software or service documentation this license and copyright declaration, making them available to end users.
==END REUSE TERMS==
